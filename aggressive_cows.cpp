/*
Problem: Aggressive Cows (Largest Minimum Distance)

Farmer John has built a new long barn with N (2 <= N <= 100,000) stalls.
The stalls are positioned along a straight line at locations x1 ... xN (0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000).

His C (2 <= C <= N) cows become aggressive if placed too close to each other. To prevent fights,
he wants to assign them to stalls such that the minimum distance between any two cows is as large as possible.
The task is to determine the largest minimum distance possible.

}

/*
Explanation:
1. Sort the stall positions.
2. Use binary search on the possible minimum distance between cows.
3. Check feasibility using `isPossible` function:
   - Place cows greedily, ensuring at least `minDist` distance.
   - If all cows are placed, return true.
4. Adjust search space based on feasibility check.
5. Return the largest minimum distance found.
*/

/*
Time Complexity:
- Sorting the array takes O(N log N).
- Binary search runs in O(log(max_dist)), where max_dist is the range of stall positions.
- The `isPossible` function runs in O(N) for each binary search iteration.
- Overall complexity: O(N log N) + O(N log(max_dist)) â‰ˆ O(N log(max_dist)).

Space Complexity:
- O(1) (constant extra space apart from input storage).
