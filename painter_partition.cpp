/*
Painterâ€™s Partition Problem

Given are N boards of length of each given in the form of an array, and M painters, such
that each painter takes 1 unit of time to paint 1 unit of the board.

The task is to find the minimum time to paint all boards under the constraints that any
painter will only paint continuous sections of boards.

/*
Explanation of the Code:

- isPossible Function: This function checks if it is possible to paint all boards within a given maximum time (maxTime). It iterates through the boards, summing their lengths. If the total exceeds maxTime, it assigns the work to a new painter and resets the total. If the number of required painters exceeds the available painters, it returns false.

- findMinTime Function: This function uses binary search to find the minimum time required to paint all boards. It initializes the search range between the maximum board length and the total length of all boards. It repeatedly checks the midpoint of the current range using the isPossible function. If it is possible to paint within that time, it tries to find a smaller time; otherwise, it increases the time limit.

- main Function: This is the entry point of the program where we define the board lengths and the number of painters, then call the findMinTime function and print the result.

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the isPossible function is O(N), where N is the number of boards.
- The binary search runs in O(log(S)), where S is the sum of all board lengths.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(N log(S)).

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size. The input array is not counted towards space complexity as it is provided by the user.
